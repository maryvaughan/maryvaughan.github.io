	<strong> Team Based Learning </strong> <br>
	For the 2018-19 school year, I was funded though the Howard Hughes Medical Institute grant. 
     In collaboration with Anna Aboud and under the direction of Heather Bolles, we developed Team-Based Learning material for 
     non-TBL instructors to implement active learning in non-TBL classes.

    <strong> Make It Stick</strong>  <br>
    In 2017, I participated in a Graduate Teaching and Learning Community to read and discuss the book <i>Make It Stick - The Science of Successful Learning</i> by Peter C. Brown. 
    In 2019, I co-lead a teaching seminar which included discussions on the book.

<font size=2> <center> "Its the questions we can't answer that teach us the most. They teach us to think. <br>
					If you give a man an answer, all he gains is a little fact. But give him a question and he'll look for his own answers. <br>
					That way, when he finds the answers, they'll be precious to him. The harder the question, the harder we hunt. <br>
					The harder we hunt, the more we learn."
