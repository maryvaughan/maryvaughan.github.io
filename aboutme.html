     <strong>Junior Analysis Seminar</strong> <br>
     This year, Animesh Biswas and myself are establishing a <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/junior-analysis-seminar/home">Junior Analysis Seminar</a> at Iowa State. 
     The seminar is for graduate students of all levels interested in analysis.

     <strong>Joint AWM-MOCA Speaker Series</strong> (JAMSS) <br>
    I am a co-founder of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/isu-jamss">JAMSS</a>
    which is run by the Iowa State Association of Women in Mathematics (AWM) Chapter 
    and Mathematicians of Color Alliance <a href="https://orion.math.iastate.edu/moca/">(MOCA)</a>. 
    I served on and was chair of the organizing committee for the 2017-18 and 2018-19 school years. 
    The series brings four-six underrepresented mathematicians to campus to speak at our departmental colloquium, lead a discussion on his/her experiences as a mathematician, 
    and have one-on-one meetings with faculty and graduate students.

     <strong>Midwest Mathematics Inclusion and Diversity Workshop for Undergraduates</strong> (MMIDWU)<br>
     I was part of an organizing committee at Iowa State hosting <a href="https://sites.google.com/iastate.edu/mmidwu18/">MMIDWU</a>.
     The workshop was designed to expose undergraduates to new mathematics as well as to discuss and reflect on the experiences of members of underrepresented groups of mathematicians.
     There were five featured speakers of various backgrounds and research interests. 
     Each talk was prefaced with a graduate run introductory session.

     <strong>Mathematics Graduate Student Organization</strong> (MathGSO) <br>
	 As a second year graduate student, I was elected to MathGSO, a group working
     to address the needs of the graduate students as well as host career day and socials.
     I spent one year as treasurer and another as the graduate student liaison which included attending the Mathematics Graduate Committee to represent the graduate students.

     <strong>Association of Women in Mathematics</strong> (AWM) <br>
     In November 2017, a group of graduate students started an <a href="https://www.stuorg.iastate.edu/site/2868"> AWM Chapter</a> at Iowa State.
     I served as interim secretary while the chapter was being formed and spent some time on the events committee.

     <strong>Personal Interests</strong>
     <ul>
     
        <li> After watching the Great British Bake Off, I bought <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mary-Berrys-Baking-Bible-Classic/dp/1846077850"> Mary Berry's Baking Bible</a> 
     and am working through all 250 recipes. 
     I may not be the 'greatest' baker, but it sure is a fun way to spend a Sunday afternoon!
     Check out my <a href="https://maryvaughan.github.io/baking.html">baking page</a> for pictures of my creations.
     </li> <br>
     
        <li>I love to travel and experience new foods and places. Someday I would like to visit all the United States National Parks and visit every continent (except Antarctica... br!). 
        So far, my favorite parks include the Great Smoky Mountains, Glacier, and Rocky Mountain. </li><br>
        
        <li> George R. R. Martin wrote "A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies... The man who never reads lives only one." You can see what I have read (perhaps years ago)
         and am currently reading on my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/merrykiiins"> Goodreads profile</a>.
         I usually read fantasy and mystery novels, but I would love you hear your recommendations, regardless of the genre!
